tg-notify-bash
==============

This is a fork of tg-notify with which it is not necessary to build the libraries CDBUS and L2DBUS. You only have to have installed libnotify (for example using Debian: sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin).

tg-notify is a Lua script which implements freedesktop notifications for Telegram CLI(https://github.com/slp/tg-notify).

For more info about the original tg-notify, read http://sinrega.org/?p=159
